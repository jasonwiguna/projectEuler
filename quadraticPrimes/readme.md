Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

n2+n+41
n

41
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0≤n≤39

. However, when n=40,402+40+41=40(40+1)+41

=

,
40

 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n=41,412+41+41
n

 is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n2−79n+1601
